# Classificaiton of Chest X-ray Images with Resnet152v2

This is my senior project classifies chest X-ray images into four classes: COVID-19, pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal using a deep learning model (ResNet152v2) with transfer learning.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes ResNet152v2 architecture.
- **Flask Web Interface**: User-friendly interface for uploading and classifying X-ray images.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chest-xray-classification.git

    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
